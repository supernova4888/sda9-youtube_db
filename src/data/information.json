Produced by Nintendo several years after the original, groundbreaking Nintendo Game Boy, the Game Boy Pocket is smaller, lighter, uses two AAA batteries and has a larger, better screen. The unit's smaller size makes it more portable and comfortable to play games on and is regarded as one of the best Game Boy models by fans.",
